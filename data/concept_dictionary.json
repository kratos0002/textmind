When Congress was still in preparation , Marx and Engels arrived at the conclusion that the final programme document should be in the form of a Party manifesto ( see Engels \u2019 letter to Marx of November 23 - 24 , 1847 ) . The catechism form usual for the secret societies of the time and retained in the \u201c and \u201c was not suitable for a full and substantial exposition of the new revolutionary world outlook , for a comprehensive formulation of the proletarian movement \u2019s aims and tasks .

        "text": "2 Introduction Editorial Introduction The \u201c was written by Marx and Engels as the Communist League \u2019s programme on the instruction of its Second Congress ( London , November 29 - December 8 , 1847 ) , which signified a victory for the followers of a new proletarian line during the discussion of the programme questions . When Congress was still in preparation , Marx and Engels arrived at the conclusion that the final programme document should be in the form of a Party manifesto ( see Engels \u2019 letter to Marx of November 23 - 24 , 1847 ) . The catechism form usual for the secret societies of the time and retained in the \u201c and \u201c was not suitable for a full and substantial exposition of the new revolutionary world outlook , for a comprehensive formulation of the proletarian movement \u2019s aims and tasks . See also \u201c issued by Marx soon after publication of the Manifesto , which addressed the immediate demands of the movement . Marx and Engels began working together on the Manifesto while they were still in London immediately after the congress , and continued until about December 13 when Marx returned to Brussels ; they resumed their work four days later ( December 17 ) when Engels arrived there . After Engels \u2019 departure for Paris at the end of December and up to his return on January 31 , Marx worked on the Manifesto alone . Hurried by the Central Authority of the Communist League which provided him with certain documents ( e.g. , addresses of the People \u2019s Chamber ( Halle ) of the League of the Just of November 1846 and February 1847 , and , apparently , documents of the First Congress of the Communist League pertaining to the discussion of the Party programme ) , Marx worked intensively on the Manifesto through almost the whole of January 1848 . At the end of January the manuscript was sent on to London to be printed in the German Workers \u2019 Educational Society \u2019s print shop owned by a German emigrant J. E. Burghard , a member of the Communist League . The manuscript of the Manifesto has not survived . The only extant materials written in Marx \u2019s hand are a draft plan for Section III , showing his efforts to improve the structure of the Manifesto , and a page of a rough copy . The Manifesto came off the press at the end of February 1848 . On February 29 , the Educational Society decided to cover all the printing expenses . The first edition of the Manifesto was a 23 - page pamphlet in a dark green cover . In April - May 1848 another edition was put out . The text took up 30 pages , some misprints of the first edition were corrected , and the punctuation improved . Subsequently this text was used by Marx and Engels as a basis for later authorised editions . Between March and July 1848 the Manifesto was printed in the Deutsche Londoner Zeitung , a democratic newspaper of the German emigrants . Already that same year numerous efforts were made to publish the Manifesto in other European languages . A Danish , a Polish ( in Paris ) and a Swedish ( under a different title : \u201c ) editions appeared in 1848 . The translations into French , Italian and Spanish made at that time remained unpublished . In April 1848 , Engels , then in Barmen , was translating the Manifesto into English , but he managed to translate only half of it , and the first English translation , made by Helen Macfarlane , was not published until two years later , between June and November 1850 , in the Chartist journal The Red Republican . Its editor , Julian Harney , named the authors for the first time in the introduction to this publication . All earlier and many subsequent editions of the Manifesto were anonymous . The growing emancipation struggle of the proletariat in the \u2019 60s and \u2019 70s of the 19th century led to new editions of the Manifesto . The year 1872 saw a new German edition with minor corrections and a preface by Marx and Engels where they drew some conclusions from the experience of the Paris",

First published in German , it has been republished in that language in at least twelve different editions in Germany , England , and America . It was published in English for the first time in 1850 in the Red Republican , London , translated by Miss Helen Macfarlane , and in 1871 in at least three different translations in America .

Now the question is : can the Russian obshchina , though greatly undermined , yet a form of primeval common ownership of land , pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership ? Or , on the contrary , must it first pass through the same process of dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the West ? The only answer to that possible today is this : If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West , so that both complement each other , the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development .

Since 1850 , the German text had been reprinted several times in Switzerland , England , and America . In 1872 , it was translated into English in New York , where the translation was published in Woorhull and Claflin \u2019s Weekly . From this English version , a French one was made in Le Socialiste of New York . Since then , at least two more English translations , more or less mutilated , have been brought out in America , and one of them has been reprinted in England . The first Russian translation , made by Bakunin , was published at Herzen \u2019 s Kolokol office in Geneva , about 1863 ; a second one , by the heroic Vera Zasulich , also in Geneva , in 1882 . A new Danish edition is to be found in Socialdemokratisk Bibliothek , Copenhagen , 1885 ; a fresh French translation in Le Socialiste , Paris , 1886 . From this latter , a Spanish version was prepared and published in Madrid , 1886 . The German reprints are not to be counted ; there have been twelve altogether at the least . An Armenian translation , which was to be published in Constantinople some months ago , did not see the light , I am told , because the publisher was afraid of bringing out a book with the name of Marx on it , while the translator declined to call it his own production . Of further translations into other languages I have heard but had not seen . Thus the history of the Manifesto reflects the history of the modern working- class movement ; at present , it is doubtless the most wide spread , the most international production of all socialist literature , the common platform acknowledged by millions of working men from Siberia to California . Yet , when it was written , we could not have called it a socialist manifesto . By Socialists , in 1847 , were understood , on the one hand the adherents of the various Utopian systems : Owenites in England , Fourierists in France , both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects , and gradually dying out ; on the other hand , the most multifarious social quacks who , by all manner of tinkering , professed to redress , without any danger to capital and profit , all sorts of social grievances , in both cases men outside the working - class movement , and looking rather to the \u201c classes for support . Whatever portion of the working class had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere political revolutions , and had proclaimed the necessity of total social change , called itself Communist . It was a crude , rough - hewn , purely instinctive sort of communism ; still , it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce the Utopian communism of Cabet in France , and of Weitling in Germany . Thus , in 1847 , socialism was a middle - class movement , communism a working - class movement . Socialism was , on the Continent at least , \u201c ; communism was the very opposite . And as our notion , from the very beginning , was that \u201c there could be no doubt as to which of the two names we must take . Moreover , we have , ever since , been far from repudiating it . The Manifesto being our joint production , I consider myself bound to state that the fundamental proposition which forms the nucleus belongs to Marx . That proposition is : That in every historical epoch , the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange , and the social organization necessarily following from it , form the basis upon which it is built up , and from that which alone can be explained the political and intellectual history of that epoch ; that consequently the whole history of mankind ( since the dissolution of primitive tribal society , holding land in common ownership ) has been a history of class struggles , contests between exploiting and exploited , ruling and oppressed classes ; That the history of these class struggles forms a series of evolutions in which , nowadays , a stage has been reached where the exploited and oppressed class \u2013 the proletariat \u2013 can not attain its emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling class \u2013 the bourgeoisie \u2013 without , at the same time , and once and for all , emancipating society at large from all exploitation , oppression , class distinction , and class struggles .

And as our notion , from the very beginning , was that \u201c there could be no doubt as to which of the two names we must take . Moreover , we have , ever since , been far from repudiating it . The Manifesto being our joint production , I consider myself bound to state that the fundamental proposition which forms the nucleus belongs to Marx . That proposition is : That in every historical epoch , the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange , and the social organization necessarily following from it , form the basis upon which it is built up , and from that which alone can be explained the political and intellectual history of that epoch ; that consequently the whole history of mankind ( since the dissolution of primitive tribal society , holding land in common ownership ) has been a history of class struggles , contests between exploiting and exploited , ruling and oppressed classes ; That the history of these class struggles forms a series of evolutions in which , nowadays , a stage has been reached where the exploited and oppressed class \u2013 the proletariat \u2013 can not attain its emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling class \u2013 the bourgeoisie \u2013 without , at the same time , and once and for all , emancipating society at large from all exploitation , oppression , class distinction , and class struggles . This proposition , which , in my opinion , is destined to do for history what Darwin \u2019 s theory has done for biology , we both of us , had been gradually approaching for some years before 1845 . How far I had independently progressed towards it is best shown by my \u201c But when I again met Marx at Brussels , in spring 1845 , he had it",

Whether the gratitude of this great body of the bourgeois will stand the present severe trial , time must show . The Commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that \u201c Of all the lies hatched at Versailles and re - echoed by the glorious European penny - a - liner , one of the most tremendous was that the Rurals represented the French peasantry . Think only of the love of the French peasant for the men to whom , after 1815 , he had to pay the milliard indemnity.19 In the eyes of the French peasant , the very existence of a great landed proprietor is in itself an encroachment on his conquests of 1789 . The bourgeois , in 1848 , had burdened his plot of land with the additional tax of 45 cents , in the franc ; but then he did so in the name of the revolution ; while now he had fomented a civil war against revolution , to shift on to the peasant \u2019s shoulders the chief load of the 5 milliards of indemnity to be paid to the Prussian . The Commune , on the other hand , in one of its first proclamations , declared that the true originators of the war would be made to pay its cost . The Commune would have delivered the peasant of the blood tax \u2013 would have given him a cheap government \u2013 transformed his present blood - suckers , the notary , advocate , executor , and other judicial vampires , into salaried communal agents , elected by , and responsible to , himself . It would have freed him of the tyranny of the garde champetre , the gendarme , and the prefect ; would have put enlightenment by the schoolmaster in the place of stultification by the priest . And the French peasant is , above all , a man of reckoning . He would find it extremely reasonable that the pay of the priest , instead of being extorted by the tax- gatherer , should only depend upon the spontaneous action of the parishioners \u2019 religious instinct . Such were the great immediate boons which the rule of the Commune \u2013 and that rule alone \u2013 held out to the French peasantry . It is , therefore , quite superfluous here to expatiate upon the more complicated but vital problems which the Commune alone was able , and at the same time compelled , to solve in favor of the peasant \u2013 viz . , the hypothecary debt , lying like an incubus upon his parcel of soil , the prol\u00e9tariat foncier ( the rural proletariat ) , daily growing upon it , and his expropriation from it enforced , at a more and more rapid rate , by the very development of modern agriculture and the competition of capitalist farming . The French peasant had elected Louis Bonaparte president of the republic ; but the Party of Order created the empire . What the French peasant really wants he commenced to show in 1849 and 1850 , by opposing his maire to the government \u2019s prefect , his school - master to the government \u2019s priest , and himself to the government \u2019s gendarme . All the laws made by the Party of Order in January and February 1850 were avowed measures of repression against the peasant . The peasant was a Bonapartist , because the Great Revolution , with all its benefits to him , was , in his eyes , personified in Napoleon . This delusion , rapidly breaking down under the Second Empire ( and in",
