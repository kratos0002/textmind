{"section": "Preface", "paragraph_index": 22, "paragraph_id": 1, "text": "2 Introduction Editorial Introduction The \u201c was written by Marx and Engels as the Communist League \u2019s programme on the instruction of its Second Congress ( London , November 29 - December 8 , 1847 ) , which signified a victory for the followers of a new proletarian line during the discussion of the programme questions . When Congress was still in preparation , Marx and Engels arrived at the conclusion that the final programme document should be in the form of a Party manifesto ( see Engels \u2019 letter to Marx of November 23 - 24 , 1847 ) . The catechism form usual for the secret societies of the time and retained in the \u201c and \u201c was not suitable for a full and substantial exposition of the new revolutionary world outlook , for a comprehensive formulation of the proletarian movement \u2019s aims and tasks . See also \u201c issued by Marx soon after publication of the Manifesto , which addressed the immediate demands of the movement . Marx and Engels began working together on the Manifesto while they were still in London immediately after the congress , and continued until about December 13 when Marx returned to Brussels ; they resumed their work four days later ( December 17 ) when Engels arrived there . After Engels \u2019 departure for Paris at the end of December and up to his return on January 31 , Marx worked on the Manifesto alone . Hurried by the Central Authority of the Communist League which provided him with certain documents ( e.g. , addresses of the People \u2019s Chamber ( Halle ) of the League of the Just of November 1846 and February 1847 , and , apparently , documents of the First Congress of the Communist League pertaining to the discussion of the Party programme ) , Marx worked intensively on the Manifesto through almost the whole of January 1848 . At the end of January the manuscript was sent on to London to be printed in the German Workers \u2019 Educational Society \u2019s print shop owned by a German emigrant J. E. Burghard , a member of the Communist League . The manuscript of the Manifesto has not survived . The only extant materials written in Marx \u2019s hand are a draft plan for Section III , showing his efforts to improve the structure of the Manifesto , and a page of a rough copy . The Manifesto came off the press at the end of February 1848 . On February 29 , the Educational Society decided to cover all the printing expenses . The first edition of the Manifesto was a 23 - page pamphlet in a dark green cover . In April - May 1848 another edition was put out . The text took up 30 pages , some misprints of the first edition were corrected , and the punctuation improved . Subsequently this text was used by Marx and Engels as a basis for later authorised editions . Between March and July 1848 the Manifesto was printed in the Deutsche Londoner Zeitung , a democratic newspaper of the German emigrants . Already that same year numerous efforts were made to publish the Manifesto in other European languages . A Danish , a Polish ( in Paris ) and a Swedish ( under a different title : \u201c ) editions appeared in 1848 . The translations into French , Italian and Spanish made at that time remained unpublished . In April 1848 , Engels , then in Barmen , was translating the Manifesto into English , but he managed to translate only half of it , and the first English translation , made by Helen Macfarlane , was not published until two years later , between June and November 1850 , in the Chartist journal The Red Republican . Its editor , Julian Harney , named the authors for the first time in the introduction to this publication . All earlier and many subsequent editions of the Manifesto were anonymous . The growing emancipation struggle of the proletariat in the \u2019 60s and \u2019 70s of the 19th century led to new editions of the Manifesto . The year 1872 saw a new German edition with minor corrections and a preface by Marx and Engels where they drew some conclusions from the experience of the Paris", "concepts": ["proletariat", "communism", "revolution"]}

This and subsequent German editions ( 1883 and 1890 ) were entitled the Communist Manifesto . In 1872 the Manifesto was first published in America in Woodhull & Claflin \u2019s Weekly . The first Russian edition of the Manifesto , translated by Mikhail Bakunin with some distortions , appeared in Geneva in 1869 . The faults of this edition were removed in the 1882 edition ( translation by Georgi Plekhanov ) , for which Marx and Engels , who attributed great significance to the dissemination of Marxism in Russia , had written a special preface . After Marx \u2019s death , the Manifesto ran into several editions . Engels read through them all , wrote prefaces for the 1883 German edition and for the 1888 English edition in Samuel Moore \u2019s translation , which he also edited and supplied with notes . This edition served as a basis for many subsequent editions of the Manifesto in English \u2013 in Britain , the United States and the USSR . In 1890 , Engels prepared a further German edition , wrote a new preface to it , and added a number of notes . In 1885 , the newspaper Le Socialiste published the French translation of the Manifesto made by Marx \u2019s daughter Laura Lafargue and read by Engels . He also wrote prefaces to the 1892 Polish and 1893 Italian editions . This edition includes the two earlier versions of the Manifesto , namely the draft \u201c and \u201c both authored by Engels , as well as the letter from Engels to Marx which poses the idea of publishing a \u201c rather than a catechism . The Manifesto addressed itself to a mass movement with historical significance , not a political sect . On the other hand , the \u201c is included to place the publication of the Manifesto in the context of the mass movement in Germany at the time , whose immediate demands are reflected by Marx in this pamphlet . Clearly the aims of the Manifesto were more far - reaching the movement in Germany at the time , and unlike the \u201c was intended to outlive the immediate conditions . The \u201c is included because in this speech Marx examines the movement of the working class manifested in the Paris Commune , and his observations here mark the only revisions to his social and historical vision made during his lifetime as a result of the development of the working class movement itself , clarifying some points and making others more concrete .", "concepts": ["proletariat", "communism"]}

Such was the origin of the following Manifesto , the manuscript of which travelled to London to be printed a few weeks before the February [ French ] Revolution [ in 1848 ] . First published in German , it has been republished in that language in at least twelve different editions in Germany , England , and America . It was published in English for the first time in 1850 in the Red Republican , London , translated by Miss Helen Macfarlane , and in 1871 in at least three different translations in America . The French version first appeared in Paris shortly before the June insurrection of 1848 , and recently in Le Socialiste of New York . A new translation is in the course of preparation . A Polish version appeared in London shortly after it was first published in Germany . A Russian translation was published in Geneva in the sixties1 . Into Danish , too , it was translated shortly after its appearance . However much that state of things may have altered during the last twenty - five years , the general principles laid down in the Manifesto are , on the whole , as correct today as ever . Here and there , some detail might be improved . The practical application of the principles will depend , as the Manifesto itself states , everywhere and at all times , on the historical conditions for the time being existing , and , for that reason , no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at the end of Section II . That passage would , in many respects , be very differently worded today . In view of the gigantic strides of Modern Industry since 1848 , and of the accompanying improved and extended organization of the working class , in view of the practical experience gained , first in the February Revolution , and then , still more , in the Paris Commune , where the proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole months , this programme has in some details been antiquated . One thing especially was proved by the Commune , viz . , that \u201c ( See The Civil War in France : Address of the General Council of the International Working Men \u2019s Association , 1871 , where this point is further developed . ) Further , it is self - evident that the criticism of socialist literature is deficient in relation to the present time , because it comes down only to 1847 ; also that the remarks on the relation of the Communists to the various opposition parties ( Section IV ) , although , in principle still correct , yet in practice are antiquated , because the political situation has been entirely changed , and the progress of history has swept from off the earth the greater portion of the political parties there enumerated . But then , the Manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any right to alter . A subsequent edition may perhaps appear with an introduction bridging the gap from 1847 to the present day ; but this reprint was too unexpected to leave us time for that .

{"section": "Preface", "paragraph_index": 85, "paragraph_id": 4, "text": "Preface to The 1882 Russian Edition The first Russian edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party , translated by Bakunin , was published early in the \u2018 sixties by the printing office of the Kolokol [ a reference to the Free Russian Printing House ] . Then the West could see in it ( the Russian edition of the Manifesto ) only a literary curiosity . Such a view would be impossible today . What a limited field the proletarian movement occupied at that time ( December 1847 ) is most clearly shown by the last section : the position of the Communists in relation to the various opposition parties in various countries . Precisely Russia and the United States are missing here . It was the time when Russia constituted the last great reserve of all European reaction , when the United States absorbed the surplus proletarian forces of Europe through immigration . Both countries provided Europe with raw materials and were at the same time markets for the sale of its industrial products . Both were , therefore , in one way of another , pillars of the existing European system . How very different today . Precisely European immigration fitted North American for a gigantic agricultural production , whose competition is shaking the very foundations of European landed property \u2013 large and small . At the same time , it enabled the United States to exploit its tremendous industrial resources with an energy and on a scale that must shortly break the industrial monopoly of Western Europe , and especially of England , existing up to now . Both circumstances react in a revolutionary manner upon America itself . Step by step , the small and middle land ownership of the farmers , the basis of the whole political constitution , is succumbing to the competition of giant farms ; at the same time , a mass industrial proletariat and a fabulous concentration of capital funds are developing for the first time in the industrial regions . And now Russia ! During the Revolution of 1848 - 9 , not only the European princes , but the European bourgeois as well , found their only salvation from the proletariat just beginning to awaken in Russian intervention . The Tsar was proclaimed the chief of European reaction . Today , he is a prisoner of war of the revolution in Gatchina 2 , and Russia forms the vanguard of revolutionary action in Europe . The Communist Manifesto had , as its object , the proclamation of the inevitable impending dissolution of modern bourgeois property . But in Russia we find , face - to - face with the rapidly flowering capitalist swindle and bourgeois property , just beginning to develop , more than half the land owned in common by the peasants . Now the question is : can the Russian obshchina , though greatly undermined , yet a form of primeval common ownership of land , pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership ? Or , on the contrary , must it first pass through the same process of dissolution such as constitutes the historical evolution of the West ? The only answer to that possible today is this : If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West , so that both complement each other , the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as the starting point for a communist development .

Marx , the man to whom the whole working class of Europe and America owes more than to any one else \u2013 rests at Highgate Cemetery and over his grave the first grass is already growing . Since his death [ March 14 , 1883 ] , there can be even less thought of revising or supplementing the Manifesto . But I consider it all the more necessary again to state the following expressly : The basic thought running through the Manifesto \u2013 that economic production , and the structure of society of every historical epoch necessarily arising therefrom , constitute the foundation for the political and intellectual history of that epoch ; that consequently ( ever since the dissolution of the primaeval communal ownership of land ) all history has been a history of class struggles , of struggles between exploited and exploiting , between dominated and dominating classes at various stages of social evolution ; that this struggle , however , has now reached a stage where the exploited and oppressed class ( the proletariat ) can no longer emancipate itself from the class which exploits and oppresses it ( the bourgeoisie ) , without at the same time forever freeing the whole of society from exploitation , oppression , class struggles \u2013 this basic thought belongs solely and exclusively to Marx . * I have already stated this many times ; but precisely now is it necessary that it also stand in front of the Manifesto itself .

At a Congress of the League , held in November 1847 , Marx and Engels were commissioned to prepare a complete theoretical and practical party programme . Drawn up in German , in January 1848 , the manuscript was sent to the printer in London a few weeks before the French Revolution of February 24 . A French translation was brought out in Paris shortly before the insurrection of June 1848 . The first English translation , by Miss Helen Macfarlane , appeared in George Julian Harney \u2019 s Red Republican , London , 1850 . A Danish and a Polish edition had also been published . The defeat of the Parisian insurrection of June 1848 \u2013 the first great battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie \u2013 drove again into the background , for a time , the social and political aspirations of the European working class . Thenceforth , the struggle for supremacy was , again , as it had been before the Revolution of February , solely between different sections of the propertied class ; the working class was reduced to a fight for political elbow - room , and to the position of extreme wing of the middle - class Radicals . Wherever independent proletarian movements continued to show signs of life , they were ruthlessly hunted down . Thus the Prussian police hunted out the Central Board of the Communist League , then located in Cologne . The members were arrested and , after eighteen months \u2019 imprisonment , they were tried in October 1852 . This celebrated \u201c lasted from October 4 till November 12 ; seven of the prisoners were sentenced to terms of imprisonment in a fortress , varying from three to six years . Immediately after the sentence , the League was formally dissolved by the remaining members . As to the Manifesto , it seemed henceforth doomed to oblivion . When the European workers had recovered sufficient strength for another attack on the ruling classes , the International Working Men \u2019 s Association sprang up . But this association , formed with the express aim of welding into one body the whole militant proletariat of Europe and America , could not at once proclaim the principles laid down in the Manifesto . The International was bound to have a programme broad enough to be acceptable to the English trade unions , to the followers of Proudhon in France , Belgium , Italy , and Spain , and to the Lassalleans in Germany . * Marx , who drew up this programme to the satisfaction of all parties , entirely trusted to the intellectual development of the working class , which was sure to result from combined action and mutual discussion . The very events and vicissitudes in the struggle against capital , the defeats even more than the victories , could not help bringing home to men \u2019 s minds the insufficiency of their various favorite nostrums , and preparing the way for a more complete insight into the true conditions for working - class emancipation . And Marx was right . The International , on its breaking in 1874 , left the workers quite different men from what it found them in 1864 . Proudhonism in France , Lassalleanism in Germany , were dying out , and even the conservative English trade unions , though most of them had long since severed their connection with the International , were gradually advancing towards that point at which , last year at Swansea , their president [ W. Bevan ] could say in their name : \u201c In fact , the principles of the Manifesto had made considerable headway among the working men of all countries . * Lassalle personally , to us , always acknowledged himself to be a disciple of Marx , and , as such , stood on the ground of the Manifesto . But in his first public agitation , 1862 - 1864 , he did not go beyond demanding co - operative workshops supported by state credit .", "concepts": ["proletariat", "communism", "revolution", "bourgeoisie"]}
{"section": "I have already stated this many times ; but precisely now is it necessary that it also stand in front of the Manifesto itself .", "paragraph_index": 31, "paragraph_id": 7, "text": "8 Preface to the 1888 English Edition The Manifesto itself came thus to the front again . Since 1850 , the German text had been reprinted several times in Switzerland , England , and America . In 1872 , it was translated into English in New York , where the translation was published in Woorhull and Claflin \u2019s Weekly . From this English version , a French one was made in Le Socialiste of New York . Since then , at least two more English translations , more or less mutilated , have been brought out in America , and one of them has been reprinted in England . The first Russian translation , made by Bakunin , was published at Herzen \u2019 s Kolokol office in Geneva , about 1863 ; a second one , by the heroic Vera Zasulich , also in Geneva , in 1882 . A new Danish edition is to be found in Socialdemokratisk Bibliothek , Copenhagen , 1885 ; a fresh French translation in Le Socialiste , Paris , 1886 . From this latter , a Spanish version was prepared and published in Madrid , 1886 . The German reprints are not to be counted ; there have been twelve altogether at the least . An Armenian translation , which was to be published in Constantinople some months ago , did not see the light , I am told , because the publisher was afraid of bringing out a book with the name of Marx on it , while the translator declined to call it his own production . Of further translations into other languages I have heard but had not seen . Thus the history of the Manifesto reflects the history of the modern working- class movement ; at present , it is doubtless the most wide spread , the most international production of all socialist literature , the common platform acknowledged by millions of working men from Siberia to California . Yet , when it was written , we could not have called it a socialist manifesto . By Socialists , in 1847 , were understood , on the one hand the adherents of the various Utopian systems : Owenites in England , Fourierists in France , both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects , and gradually dying out ; on the other hand , the most multifarious social quacks who , by all manner of tinkering , professed to redress , without any danger to capital and profit , all sorts of social grievances , in both cases men outside the working - class movement , and looking rather to the \u201c classes for support . Whatever portion of the working class had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere political revolutions , and had proclaimed the necessity of total social change , called itself Communist . It was a crude , rough - hewn , purely instinctive sort of communism ; still , it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce the Utopian communism of Cabet in France , and of Weitling in Germany . Thus , in 1847 , socialism was a middle - class movement , communism a working - class movement . Socialism was , on the Continent at least , \u201c ; communism was the very opposite . And as our notion , from the very beginning , was that \u201c there could be no doubt as to which of the two names we must take . Moreover , we have , ever since , been far from repudiating it . The Manifesto being our joint production , I consider myself bound to state that the fundamental proposition which forms the nucleus belongs to Marx . That proposition is : That in every historical epoch , the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange , and the social organization necessarily following from it , form the basis upon which it is built up , and from that which alone can be explained the political and intellectual history of that epoch ; that consequently the whole history of mankind ( since the dissolution of primitive tribal society , holding land in common ownership ) has been a history of class struggles , contests between exploiting and exploited , ruling and oppressed classes ; That the history of these class struggles forms a series of evolutions in which , nowadays , a stage has been reached where the exploited and oppressed class \u2013 the proletariat \u2013 can not attain its emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling class \u2013 the bourgeoisie \u2013 without , at the same time , and once and for all , emancipating society at large from all exploitation , oppression , class distinction , and class struggles . This proposition , which , in my opinion , is destined to do for history what Darwin \u2019 s theory has done for biology , we both of us , had been gradually approaching for some years before 1845 . How far I had independently progressed towards it is best shown by my \u201c But when I again met Marx at Brussels , in spring 1845 , he had it", "concepts": ["exploitation", "proletariat", "socialism", "bourgeoisie", "surplus value", "communism"]}

Whether the gratitude of this great body of the bourgeois will stand the present severe trial , time must show . The Commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that \u201c Of all the lies hatched at Versailles and re - echoed by the glorious European penny - a - liner , one of the most tremendous was that the Rurals represented the French peasantry . Think only of the love of the French peasant for the men to whom , after 1815 , he had to pay the milliard indemnity.19 In the eyes of the French peasant , the very existence of a great landed proprietor is in itself an encroachment on his conquests of 1789 . The bourgeois , in 1848 , had burdened his plot of land with the additional tax of 45 cents , in the franc ; but then he did so in the name of the revolution ; while now he had fomented a civil war against revolution , to shift on to the peasant \u2019s shoulders the chief load of the 5 milliards of indemnity to be paid to the Prussian . The Commune , on the other hand , in one of its first proclamations , declared that the true originators of the war would be made to pay its cost . The Commune would have delivered the peasant of the blood tax \u2013 would have given him a cheap government \u2013 transformed his present blood - suckers , the notary , advocate , executor , and other judicial vampires , into salaried communal agents , elected by , and responsible to , himself . It would have freed him of the tyranny of the garde champetre , the gendarme , and the prefect ; would have put enlightenment by the schoolmaster in the place of stultification by the priest . And the French peasant is , above all , a man of reckoning . He would find it extremely reasonable that the pay of the priest , instead of being extorted by the tax- gatherer , should only depend upon the spontaneous action of the parishioners \u2019 religious instinct . Such were the great immediate boons which the rule of the Commune \u2013 and that rule alone \u2013 held out to the French peasantry . It is , therefore , quite superfluous here to expatiate upon the more complicated but vital problems which the Commune alone was able , and at the same time compelled , to solve in favor of the peasant \u2013 viz . , the hypothecary debt , lying like an incubus upon his parcel of soil , the prol\u00e9tariat foncier ( the rural proletariat ) , daily growing upon it , and his expropriation from it enforced , at a more and more rapid rate , by the very development of modern agriculture and the competition of capitalist farming . The French peasant had elected Louis Bonaparte president of the republic ; but the Party of Order created the empire . What the French peasant really wants he commenced to show in 1849 and 1850 , by opposing his maire to the government \u2019s prefect , his school - master to the government \u2019s priest , and himself to the government \u2019s gendarme . All the laws made by the Party of Order in January and February 1850 were avowed measures of repression against the peasant . The peasant was a Bonapartist , because the Great Revolution , with all its benefits to him , was , in his eyes , personified in Napoleon .

The Rurals \u2013 this was , in fact , their chief apprehension \u2013 knew that three months \u2019 free communication of Communal Paris with the provinces would bring about a general rising of the peasants , and hence their anxiety to establish a police blockade around Paris , so as to stop the spread of the rinderpest [ cattle pest \u2013 contagious disease ] . If the Commune was thus the true representative of all the healthy elements of French society , and therefore the truly national government , it was , at the same time , as a working men \u2019s government , as the bold champion of the emancipation of labor , emphatically international . Within sight of that Prussian army , that had annexed to Germany two French provinces , the Commune annexed to France the working people all over the world . The Second Empire had been the jubilee of cosmopolitan blackleggism , the rakes of all countries rushing in at its call for a share in its orgies and in the plunder of the French people . Even at this moment , the right hand of Thiers is Ganessco , the foul Wallachian , and his left hand is Markovsky , the Russian spy . The Commune admitted all foreigners to the honor of dying for an immortal cause . Between the foreign war lost by their treason , and the civil war fomented by their conspiracy with the foreign invader , the bourgeoisie had found the time to display their patriotism by organizing police hunts upon the Germans in France . The Commune made a German working man [ Leo Frankel ] its Minister of Labor . Thiers , the bourgeoisie , the Second Empire , had continually deluded Poland by loud professions of sympathy , while in reality betraying her to , and doing the dirty work of , Russia . The Commune honoured the heroic sons of Poland [ J. Dabrowski and W. Wr\u00f3blewski ] by placing them at the head of the defenders of Paris . And , to broadly mark the new era of history it was conscious of initiating , under the eyes of the conquering Prussians on one side , and the Bonapartist army , led by Bonapartist generals , on the other , the Commune pulled down that colossal symbol of martial glory , the Vend\u00f4me Column.20 The great social measure of the Commune was its own working existence . Its special measures could but betoken the tendency of a government of the people by the people . Such were the abolition of the nightwork of journeymen bakers ; the prohibition , under penalty , of the employers \u2019 practice to reduce wages by levying upon their workpeople fines under manifold pretexts \u2013 a process in which the employer combines in his own person the parts of legislator , judge , and executor , and filches the money to boot . Another measure of this class was the surrender to associations of workmen , under reserve of compensation , of all closed workshops and factories , no matter whether the respective capitalists had absconded or preferred to strike work . The financial measures of the Commune , remarkable for their sagacity and moderation , could only be such as were compatible with the state of a besieged town . Considering the colossal robberies committed upon the city of Paris by the great financial companies and contractors , under the protection of Haussman,21 the Commune would have had an incomparably better title to confiscate their property than Louis Napoleon had against the Orleans family . The Hohenzollern and the English oligarchs , who both have derived a good deal of their estates from church plunders , were , of course , greatly shocked at the Commune clearing but 8,000f out of secularization . While the Versailles government , as soon as it had recovered some spirit and strength , used the most violent means against the Commune ; while it put down the free expression of opinion all over France , even to the forbidding of meetings of delegates from the large towns ; while it subjected Versailles and the rest of France to an espionage far surpassing that of the Second Empire ; while it burned by its gendarme inquisitors all papers printed at Paris , and sifted all correspondence from and to Paris ; while in the National Assembly the most timid attempts to put in a word for Paris were howled down in a manner unknown even to the Chambre introuvable of", "concepts": ["proletariat", "bourgeoisie"]}

Had the government of the Commune been akin to that of M. Thiers , there would have been no more occasion to suppress Party of Order papers at Paris that there was to suppress Communal papers at Versailles . It was irritating indeed to the Rurals that at the very same time they declared the return to the church to be the only means of salvation for France , the infidel Commune unearthed the peculiar mysteries of the Picpus nunnery22 , and of the Church of St. Laurent . It was a satire upon M. Thiers that , while he showered grand crosses upon the Bonapartist generals in acknowledgment of their mastery in losing battles , singing capitulations , and turning cigarettes at Wilhelmsh\u00f6he,23 the Commune dismissed and arrested its generals whenever they were suspected of neglecting their duties . The expulsion from , and arrest by , the Commune of one of its members [ Blanchet ] who had slipped in under a false name , and had undergone at Lyons six days \u2019 imprisonment for simple bankruptcy , was it not a deliberate insult hurled at the forger , Jules Favre , then still the foreign minister of France , still selling France to Bismarck , and still dictating his orders to that paragon government of Belgium ? But indeed the Commune did not pretend to infallibility , the invariable attribute of all governments of the old stamp . It published its doings and sayings , it initiated the public into all its shortcomings . In every revolution there intrude , at the side of its true agents , men of different stamp ; some of them survivors of and devotees to past revolutions , without insight into the present movement , but preserving popular influence by their known honesty and courage , or by the sheer force of tradition ; others mere brawlers who , by dint of repeating year after year the same set of stereotyped declarations against the government of the day , have sneaked into the reputation of revolutionists of the first water . After March 18 , some such men did also turn up , and in some cases contrived to play pre - eminent parts . As far as their power went , they hampered the real action of the working class , exactly as men of that sort have hampered the full development of every previous revolution . They are an unavoidable evil : with time they are shaken off ; but time was not allowed to the Commune . Wonderful , indeed , was the change the Commune had wrought in Paris ! No longer any trace of the tawdry Paris of the Second Empire ! No longer was Paris the rendezvous of British landlords , Irish absentees , 24 American ex - slaveholders and shoddy men , Russian ex - serfowners , and Wallachian boyards . No more corpses at the morgue , no nocturnal burglaries , scarcely any robberies ; in fact , for the first time since the days of February 1848 , the streets of Paris were safe , and that without any police of any kind . \u201c said a member of the Commune , \u201c The cocottes had refound the scent of their protectors \u2013 the absconding men of family , religion , and , above all , of property . In their stead , the real women of Paris showed again at the surface \u2013 heroic , noble , and devoted , like the women of antiquity . Working , thinking fighting , bleeding Paris \u2013 almost forgetful , in its incubation of a new society , of the Cannibals at its gates \u2013 radiant in the enthusiasm of its historic initiative !

Published in Geneva in 1869 ( printing it in Russia was impossible due to state censorship ) , Bakunin \u2019 s translation was not completely accurate , and was replaced a decade later by Plekhanov \u2019s translation in 1882 , for which both Marx and Engels wrote a preface . 2 A reference to the events that occurred in Russia after the assassination , on March , 1 , 1881 , of Emperor Alexander II by Narodnaya Volya members . Alexander III , his successor , was staying in Gatchina for fear of further terrorism . 3 This preface was written by Engels on May 1 , 1890 , when , in accordance with the decision of the Paris Congress of the Second International ( July 1889 ) , mass demonstrations , strikes and meetings were held in numerous European and American countries . The workers put forward the demand for an 8 hour working day and other demands set forth by the Congress . From that day forward workers all over the world celebrate the first of May as a day of international proletarian solidarity . 4 A reference to the movement for an electoral reform which , under the pressure of the working class , was passed by the British House of Commons in 1831 and finally endorsed by the House of Lords in June , 1832 . The reform was directed against monopoly rule of the landed and finance aristocracy and opened the way to Parliament for the representatives of the industrial bourgeoisie . Neither workers nor the petty - bourgeois were allowed electoral rights , despite assurances they would . 5 The famous final phrase of the Manifesto , \u201c , in the original German is : \u201c Thus , a more correct translation would be \u201c \u201c is a popularisation of the last three sentences , and is not found in any official translation . Since this English translation was approved by Engels , we have kept the original intact . 6 In their works written in later periods , Marx and Engels substituted the more accurate concepts of \u201c , \u201c and \u201c ( first introduced by Marx ) for \u201c , \u201c and \u201c , as used here . 7 Engels left half a page blank here in the manuscript . The \u201c has the answer shown for the same question ( Number 12 ) . 8 Engels \u2019 put \u201c here , referring to the answer in the June draft under No . 21 as shown . 9 Similarly , this refers to the answer to Question 23 in the June draft . 10 The Chartists were the participants in the political movement of the British workers which lasted from the 1830s to the middle 1850s and had as its slogan the adoption of a People \u2019s Charter , demanding universal franchise and a series of conditions guaranteeing voting rights for all workers . Lenin defined Chartism as the world \u2019s \u201c ( Collected Works , Eng . ed . , Progress Publishers , Moscow , 1965 , Vol . 29 , p. 309 . ) The decline of the Chartist movement was due to the strengthening of Britain \u2019s industrial and commercial monopoly and the bribing of the upper stratum of the working class ( \u201c ) by the British bourgeoisie out of its super - profits . Both factors led to the strengthening of opportunist tendencies in this stratum as expressed , in particular , by the refusal of the trade union leaders to support Chartism . 11 Probably a references to the National Reform Association , founded during the 1840s by George H.
